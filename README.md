//still writing it!

If you're trying to find a better way of dealing with your pets' care and helth, you'll certainly you've come to right place!
PET+ is not only a way of organizing the info about your pet+, but also a way of simplifying the process!
Is it hard to grasp what is PET+? Simple here's an example:

-- Ooooh my gosh, I love my cat TOM, but it's a problem for me to write down on a piece of paper, or on my notes, what are the vaccines and other things TOM needs to take, even its basic cares. How could I travel without any concernings if he's going to be ok... ðŸ˜”
-- Well you have PET+, just sign in, and add your PET+, their info will be on the internet and will make everything easier!

That is the idea of the project.

At the moment you're able to create and account and login, if you want to try it, you can! And of course uploading a profile picture for you account.
Soon I'll be creating the main content of the application, which will allow you to upload pictures of your animal, and of course, list them, as I supposed if the user has more than one pet.
Yet not complete it, it's responsive.
